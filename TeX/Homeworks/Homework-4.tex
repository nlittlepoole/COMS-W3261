\section*{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Classify each of the following languages as being (i) recursive, (ii)
recursively enumerable but not recursive, or (iii) not recursively enumerable.
In each case briefly justify your answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\{\,D\,|\,D$ is a deterministic finite automaton that accepts at least
one string with an equal number of $a$'s and $b$'s$\,\}$.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item $\{\,(D_1,D_2)\,|\,D_1$ and $D_2$ are deterministic finite automata and
$L(D_1) = L(D_2)\,\}$
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item $\{\,(M,w)\,|\,M$ is a Turing machine that halts on input $w\,\}$.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item $\{\,(M_1,M_2)\,|\,M_1$ and $M_2$ are Turing machines and $L(M_1) =
L(M_2)\,\}$
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\end{enumerate}

\item Boolean expressions
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe an algorithm in high-level pseudocode to evaluate a boolean
expression given a truth assignment to its variables. Describe how your
algorithm evaluates the boolean expression $x \vee \neg(y \wedge z)$ for the
truth assignment $T(x) = 0$, $T(y) = 0$, $T(z) = 1$. (1 is true, 0 is false)
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item What is the time complexity of your algorithm?
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item Describe an algorithm in high-level pseudocode to determine whether a
boolean expression always evaluates to true on all truth assignments to its
variables (is a tautology). Illustrate how your algorithm performs on the
boolean expression $x \vee \neg (y \wedge x)$.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item What is the time complexity of your algorithm?
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\end{enumerate}

\item The game PEBBLES is played on an $k \times n$ chessboard. Initially each
square of the chessboard has a black pebble, or a white pebble, or no pebble.
You play the game by removing pebbles one at a time. You win the game if you can
end up with a board in which each column contains only pebbles of a single color
and each row contains at least one pebble.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the set of winnable PEBBLES game is in NP. Hint: Describe a
nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithm to  determine whether a given PEBBLES
board is winnable.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item Given a boolean expression $E$ in 3-CNF with $k$ clauses and $n$
variables, construct the following $k \times n$ board: If literal $x_i$ is in
clause $c_j$, put a black pebble in column $x_i$, row $c_j$. If literal $\neg
x_i$ is in clause $c_j$, put a white pebble in column $x_i$, row $c_j$. Show
that $E$ is satisfiable if and only if this PEBBLES game is winnable.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item What can you conclude from showing (a) and (b)?
\item[\emph{Solution}:]
\end{enumerate}

\item A polynomial-time verifier for a language $L$ is an algorithm $V$ such
that $L = \{\,w\,|\,V$ accepts $(w,c)$ in polynomial time for some polynomial-
length string $c$ called a certificate or proof of membership in $L\,\}$. Show
that NP is equivalent to the class of languages that have polynomial-time
verifiers.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item The classes P and NP
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that if language $A$ is NP-complete and $A$ is in P, then P=NP.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]

\item Show that if $A$ is NP-complete and $A$ is polynomially reducible to a
language $B$ in NP, then $B$ is NP-complete.
\item[\emph{Solution}:]
