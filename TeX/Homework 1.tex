\section*{Problems}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use a computer program that supports regular expressions to find the 
    lexicographically first longest English word in the dictionary that can be
    made up using only letters in your first and last name. A letter in your 
    name can be used zero or more times. Show the regular expression and program
    you used to find your answer.
    \item In Lecture 2 (September 8, 2014) we presented a three-state DFA that
    recognizes exactly those binary strings representing integers divisible by 
    3. Using induction, prove that state A represents all and only the prefixes 
    of binary strings that are numbers congruent to 0 mod 3, state B all and 
    only the prefixes congruent to 1 mod 3, and state C all and only the 
    prefixes congruent to 2 mod 3.
    \item Let $L$ be the language generated by the regular expression 
    $(a+b)^*a(a+b)(a+b)$
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Construct a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) for $L$. 
        (Identify the five components of your NFA. Use a transition diagram for 
        the transition function.)
        \item Show how your NFA processes the input string \texttt{abaab}.
        \item Using the subset construction convert your NFA into an equivalent 
        DFA.
        \item Show how your DFA processes the input string \texttt{abaab}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Construct an epsilon-NFA from the regular expression in problem (3) 
    using the McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson algorithm. Show how your epsilon-NFA 
    processes the input string \texttt{abaab}.
    \item Let $L$ be the language $\{ w \, | \, w$ is any string of $a$'s and $b
    $'s where the number of $a$'s is different from the number of $b$'s $\}$. If 
    $L$ is regular, construct a DFA for $L$; if not, prove that $L$ is not 
    regular.
  \end{enumerate}
