\section*{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Informally describe a Turing machine that accepts all strings of the form
$\{\,a^nb^nc^n\,|\,n\geq1\,\}$. Show the sequence of ID's that your TM goes
through starting with the input $aabbcc$.
\item Consider the following Turing machine
\[ M = (\{A, B, C, D\}, \{a\}, \{a, X, 0 1, \#\}, \delta, A, \#, \{D\}).\]
Here, we are using \# for the blank symbol.
The transition function $\delta$ is given by the following table:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c }
State & $a$   & $X$    & $0$   & $1$   & $\#$   \\ \hline
$A$   & $BXL$ & $AXR$  & $A0R$ & $A1R$ & $C\#L$ \\
$B$   & $BaL$ & $BXL$  & $A1R$ & $B0L$ & $A1R$  \\
$C$   & $-$   & $C\#L$ & $D0R$ & $D1R$ & $-$    \\
$D$   & $-$   & $-$    & $-$   & $-$   & $-$
\end{tabular}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show the sequence of ID's that $M$ goes through starting with the input
$aaaa$.
\item Starting with an input consisting of $n$ $a$'s, $n > 0$, what string will
this Turing machine have on its tape after it has halted?
\item Briefly explain how the Turing machine does this computation and
characterize the role of each state.
\item Using big-O notation, how many moves will this Turing machine make on an
input consisting of $n$ $a$'s before halting? Briefly justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}
\item Let $L = \{\,p\,|\,p$ is a polynomial over a single variable $x$ with an
integral root $\}$. (Example: $2x^3-9x^2+16$ is a polynomial over $x$ with an
integral root $4$ and would therefore be in $L$.) Describe at an informal level
a Turing machine $M$ such that $L(M) = L$ showing that $L$ is recursively
enumerable.
\item Post's Correspondence Problems.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is PCP with a single-symbol alphabet decidable? Briefly justify your
answer.
\item Is PCP with a two-symbol alphabet decidable? Briefly justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}
\item What class of languages can a Turing machine recognize if it
\begin{enumerate}
\item Has only two working states, and one accepting state from which it never
makes any transitions?
\item Never overprints a different symbol on the input tape? That is, if in the
transition function for the Turing machine whenever $(q, Y, D)$ is in
$\delta(p,X)$, then $Y = X$.
\item Has only $\{0, 1, B\}$ as tape symbols?
\item Never moves its input head left?
\end{enumerate}
Give a brief one or two-sentence justification for each of your answers.
\end{enumerate}
