\section*{Problems}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the grammar $G$:
      \[ S \rightarrow a S b S \, | \, b S a S \, | \epsilon \]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Describe in English the language generated by $G$. Prove that $G$ 
        generates precisely this language.
        \item Is the language generated by $G$ regular? Prove your answer.
        \item Demonstrate whether $G$ is ambiguous or unambiguous.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Put the grammar $G$ in question (1) into Chomsky Normal Form. Use the 
    Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm to parse the sentence \texttt{abab} according 
    to your CNF grammar. Display the CYK table constructed by the CYK algorithm 
    and show how all parse trees for this sentence can be reconstructed from the 
    CYK table.
    \item From the grammar $G$ in question (1), construct a pushdown automaton 
    that accepts $L(G)$ by empty stack. Show all sequences of moves that your 
    PDA can make to accept the input string \texttt{abab}.
    \item From your PDA in question (3), construct an equivalent context-free 
    grammar. Show a parse tree for the input string \texttt{ababa} according to 
    your grammar.
    \item Consider the language $L$ consisting of all strings of $a$'s and $b$'s 
    that are even-length palindromes with the same number of $a$'s as $b$'s. If 
    $L$ is context free, construct a CFG for $L$ and prove that your grammar 
    generates precisely this language. If $L$ is not context free, use the 
    pumping lemma for context-free languages to prove that $L$ is not context 
    free.
  \end{enumerate}
